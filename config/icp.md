TARGET AUDIENCE:
Solopreneurs (Day 1 - Year 1). Solo operator drowning in chaos—no systems, everything in their head. Craft-lover who fears ops. Needs step-zero tactical help, not theory.

PAIN: They're alone in the fucking world. They ARE every function—sales, delivery, support, ops. It's challenging but also brutal. No one to share the load.

VOICE THEY RESPOND TO: Trench veteran—tactical, no-bullshit, practical. NOT corporate consultant or general on a hill.
