# Comprehensive Voice Contract — Alex Hormozi Style
*(Working spec for writers and editors. English.)*

---

## 0) Purpose & Scope
This contract defines how to **write in Alex Hormozi’s voice** without plagiarizing him. It captures the essence — direct, evidence-minded, action-driving prose — so any writer can deliver consistent copy across posts, threads, emails, landing pages, and long-form.

**Goal:** Produce writing that feels like a high-performance coach: **simple words, hard truths, useful tactics, zero fluff.**  
**Non-Goal:** Sounding like a parody or fanboy. Do not mimic exact phrasing, stories, or proprietary frameworks verbatim.

**Legal/Ethical:** Quote sparingly with attribution. Do **not** lift distinctive passages from his books or posts.

---

## 1) Pillars of Voice (Tone & Attitude)
**What it feels like:** Tough-love coach who believes you can win if you face reality and execute.

- **Direct, no-nonsense.** Say the thing. Cut hedges and filler.  
  *“It costs more, takes longer, and hurts more than you think.”*
- **Empowering responsibility.** Put agency on the reader.  
  *“The market is your mirror. If it’s not buying, fix you.”*
- **Optimistic realism.** Pain is a toll, not a tragedy.  
  *“Anxiety means you’re stretching your capacity.”*
- **Polarizing edge.** Invite disagreement when truth is useful.  
  *“Most small businesses don’t need more ideas, they need more execution.”*

**Avoid:** syrupy motivation, passive voice, vague generalities, sentimental storytelling that does not advance a point.

---

## 2) Language Rules (Diction & Syntax)
- **Simple words.** Grade 4–6 readability. Use *win, lose, stuck, proof, volume, reps*.  
- **Strong verbs.** *Ship. Sell. Scale. Cut. Focus. Execute. Pay. Train.*  
- **Numbers beat adjectives.** Use quantifiers and thresholds. *“Under $1M a year? Advertise more.”*  
- **Short sentences.** Default one clause. Rarely more than one comma.  
- **Second person (“you”).** Speak to one operator.  
- **One metaphor max** and obvious.

**Ban list:** jargon (*synergy, paradigm, leverage* as a noun), academic hedges (*may, might, perhaps* unless needed for precision), decorative metaphors that obscure meaning, filler openers (*“In a world where…”, “The reality is that…”*).

### 2a) Anti-AI cadence and diction rules
- **No metronome rhythm.** Do not stack five equal-length sentences. Mix one long with one short.  
- **Kill clichés without anchors.** *jungle, game-changer, disruptor*. Swap one cliché for one concrete noun or number.  
- **Ditch generic verbs.** Replace *optimize, leverage, drive* with concrete actions: *purge, cap, merge, throttle, archive*.  
- **Avoid moralizing tone.** Skip sermon words (*be brave, never quit*). Show consequence or a small scene.  
- **Limit imperative chains.** Do not machine-gun “Do X. Do Y. Do Z.” Blend imperative plus conditional plus a cold fact.  
- **No adjective piles.** One useful adjective or none. Prefer a count or threshold.  
- **Add friction.** If you make a claim, give a counter case or boundary.  
- **Self-mention sparingly.** No auto-biography unless it carries unique proof.

---

## 3) Structure & Formatting
- **Hook → Truth → Proof → Action**  
  - *Hook:* one-line claim or tension.  
  - *Truth:* the principle.  
  - *Proof:* number, example, contrast, equation, or simple model.  
  - *Action:* what to do next.
- **Micro-paragraphs.** 1–3 sentences each.  
- **Lists for steps and contrasts.** Prefer bullets or 1-2-3.  
- **Punchy closes.** End on an imperative or inversion.  
- **All-caps sparingly.** Emphasize one term max: *PROOF, VOLUME, FOCUS.*  
- **Line breaks with intent.** Break for emphasis or idea shifts, not decoration.

**Lengths:**  
- X or Threads: 100–280 chars (single), 1–6 bullets (thread).  
- LinkedIn: 120–220 words.  
- Email: 200–400 words, skimmable.  
- Long-form: sections of 200–400 words with clear subheads.

---

## 4) Themes & Angles (What to Talk About)
- **Mindset as throughput:** pain, sacrifice, discipline, long horizon, ownership.  
- **Execution over ideation:** volume, reps, offer-market fit, proof stacks.  
- **Acquisition basics:** advertise more, publish more, build proof, follow up.  
- **Operator reality:** tradeoffs, constraints, math of growth, boring work that scales.  
- **Wealth frames:** results over optics; process over hacks.

**Off-limits:** politics, gossip, vague lifestyle tips, personal confessions without utility.

---

## 5) Rhetorical Devices (How to Hit)
- **Contrast pairs:** *poor vs rich actions, amateur vs pro*.  
- **Inversions:** *“You do not have a competitor problem. You have an obscurity problem.”*  
- **Threshold rules:** *“If <X, then do Y.”*  
- **Mini-equations:** simple and legible.  
- **Rhetorical questions:** sparse, to set a punch.

---

## 6) Do and Do Not (Quick Reference)

| Aspect | Do | Do not |
|---|---|---|
| Tone | **Say hard truths** and give a next step | Cushion with *maybe, kinda* |
| Diction | **Short, common words** | MBA jargon or Latinate fluff |
| Structure | **Hook → Truth → Proof → Action** | Long intros and soft closes |
| Evidence | **Numbers, thresholds, simple rules** | Vibes, “people say”, empty name-drops |
| Engagement | **Second person (“you”)** | Abstract “we as a society” takes |
| Emphasis | **One cap word max** | All-caps rants |
| Rhythm | **Mix long and short** | Metronome sentence lengths |
| Verbs | **Concrete actions** | Generic *optimize, leverage* |
| Ethics | **Attribute quotes/frameworks** | Copy distinctive lines |

---

## 7) Templates (Fill-In)
**A) One-liner (X or Threads)**  
- *You do not have a ______ problem. You have a ______ problem.*  
- *Under ______ a year? Do ______ first. Everything else is a distraction.*

**B) Playbook (3–6 bullets)**  
- **Goal:** ______  
- **Do:** 1) ______ 2) ______ 3) ______  
- **Stop:** ______  
- **Metric:** win when ______.

**C) Offer nudge (short email or post)**

---

## 8) Examples (Original, On-Voice)
**Example 1 — Mindset**  
*Hook:* You are not blocked. You are avoiding the work.  
*Truth:* Skill compounds. Avoidance compounds faster.  
*Proof:* 100 cold calls beat 100 ideas.  
*Action:* Make 20 calls before lunch. Track yes and no. Repeat daily.

**Example 2 — Acquisition threshold**  
Under $1M a year? Advertise more.  
Not because ads are magic. Because **no one knows you exist**.

**Example 3 — Contrast**  
Amateurs chase motivation. Pros build routines.  
Routines survive bad days. Motivation does not.

**Example 4 — Offer proof**  
Confidence comes from **evidence**: volume times consistency.  
Do the reps. Then believe.

---

## 9) Writing Process (How to Produce This Voice)
1. **Block time.** 2–3 hour deep work.  
2. **Draft ugly and fast.** Aim for 3× final length.  
3. **Cut 40–60 percent.** Shorten sentences. Kill hedges. Remove one metaphor.  
4. **Add numbers.** Swap two adjectives for one threshold.  
5. **Action check.** End with one concrete next step.  
6. **Read aloud.** If you run out of breath, split the line.  
7. **Ship volume.** Track outputs and response (CTR, saves, replies).

## 11) Red Flags (Smells Like Fake-Hormozi)
- Motivational wallpaper with zero numbers  
- Generic hustle clichés with stock metaphors  
- Five same-length lines that march like a drum  
- Imperative lists with no conditions or proof  
- Adjective stacks instead of thresholds  
- Over-complex frameworks or fake math

---

## 12) Scoring Rubric (0–5)
- **5** — Hook hits. Numbers present. Clear action. Zero fluff. Feels like a coach.  
- **4** — Strong with one miss (weak number or soft close).  
- **3** — Usable; needs cuts and a number.  
- **2** — Motivational fog; rewrite required.  
- **1** — Off-voice; send back.

---

## 13) Mini Style Guide (Mechanics)
- **Case:** sentence case; no Title Case in body  
- **Hyphens:** prefer *tough-love, pay-off*  
- **Numbers:** use numerals (3, 10, 1,000)  
- **Swear words:** purposeful and sparse  
- **Quotes:** block or inline with attribution  
- **Punctuation:** no em dash; use periods or a simple hyphen  
- **Self-reference:** avoid unless needed for unique proof

---

## 14) Adaptation Patterns (Channel-Specific)
**X or Threads (single):**  
- One hard truth or one threshold rule. One line. 100–180 chars.

**X or Threads (thread 4–6):**  
1) Hook  
2–4) Truth plus proof bullets  
5) Action  
6) One-line close

**LinkedIn:**  
- 120–220 words. 3–5 mini-paragraphs plus one list.  
- End with one forcing question (*“Which one will you do today?”*).

**Email (short lesson):**  
- Subject equals result plus constraint (*“Add $10k a month without new leads”*).  
- H to T to P to A body, 200–350 words.

---

## 15) Quick Start (10-Minute Draft Flow)
1. Write 10 hooks. Pick one.  
2. State one truth in 12 words.  
3. Add one number (threshold, count, or time).  
4. End with one action the reader can do today.  
5. Cut 50 percent. Ship.

---

## 16) Example Rewrites (Before and After)

**Before:**  
“Success requires a paradigm shift in your approach to marketing strategy.”  
**After:**  
“Want more revenue? Make more offers. Track closes. Fix the one step that leaks.”

**Before:**  
“We often underestimate the importance of consistent public communication.”  
**After:**  
“No one buys if no one knows you. Publish daily. Sell weekly. Ask daily.”

**Before:**  
“Improve campaign efficiency by leveraging optimization best practices.”  
**After:**  
“Purge ads with CPM above 12 and zero sales in 48 hours. Then talk.”

---

## 17) Editor Notes (How to Coach Writers)
- Ask: *Where is the proof? Where is the action?*  
- Replace two adjectives with one number.  
- Split any line with two commas.  
- Make the close command-like: *Do X by Y.*

---

## 18) Final Reminders
- **Essence over imitation.** Be useful, blunt, specific.  
- **Volume over perfection.** Reps create signal.  
- **Evidence over ego.** Numbers win.
