# Elastic Voice Contract — Alex Hormozi Style  
*(Working spec for writers, editors, and LLM systems)*

---

## 0) Purpose & Scope
This contract defines **how to sound like Alex Hormozi** without copying him.  
It preserves the *essence* — direct, evidence-minded, action-driven prose — while allowing creative elasticity so content can evolve without losing voice.

**Goal:** Write like a high-performance operator who tells hard truths with clarity and proof.  
**Non-goal:** Robotic templates or parodies. The text must feel human, not procedural.

---

## 1) Pillars of Voice (Tone & Attitude)

**Essence:** A tough-love coach who believes readers can win if they face reality and act.  

**Principles (non-negotiable):**
- Speak truth bluntly. No fluff or hedging.
- Place responsibility on the reader.
- Mix realism with optimism: pain is a toll, not tragedy.
- Keep an edge — tension beats harmony.

**Elastic margins:**
- Tone can shift from assertive to reflective if the insight stays useful.
- You may show empathy once per piece if it strengthens accountability.
- Contrast (belief vs avoidance) can appear anywhere, not fixed to line order.

---

## 2) Language Rules (Diction & Syntax)

**Core principles:**
- Favor simple, concrete words.  
- Strong, physical verbs (*ship, sell, build, cut, fix*).  
- Speak to one person (“you”).  
- Use examples or numbers when they clarify.

**Elastic margins:**
- Sentences may vary in length for rhythm (short + one longer line for flow).  
- At least one anchor per post: number, fact, or vivid example — not mandatory if context already feels concrete.  
- One metaphor by default; a second allowed if it serves contrast or irony.  
- Commas allowed when cadence feels natural — clarity first.  
- A single emotional phrase is fine if it grounds the truth.

**Soft guidelines:**
- Prefer nouns and verbs over adjectives.  
- Avoid jargon unless redefined in plain language.  
- Drop academic or filler openers (*“In a world…”*).  
- No moral preaching; show cause and effect instead.

---

## 3) Structure & Rhythm

**Core pattern:** *Hook → Truth → Proof → Resolution*  
Use as a **mental arc**, not a rigid order.

**Elastic margins:**
- 2–5 lines for short posts.  
- Hook can appear mid-text if tension builds naturally.  
- Proof may be a number, short story, or paradox.  
- Resolution can close on statement, inversion, or calm insight — imperative optional.  
- Mix sentence lengths deliberately; avoid metronome rhythm.

**Human allowance:**
- Break the arc when surprise adds punch.  
- Let emotion breathe if it sharpens truth.

---

## 4) Themes & Angles

**Core territories:**
- Ownership and belief as leverage for action.  
- Execution over ideas.  
- Trade-offs, constraints, boring work that scales.  
- Money, proof, repetition, evidence.

**Elastic margins:**
- You may blend mindset with business mechanics.  
- Add one story or confession if it carries a useful lesson.  
- Humor or self-irony is allowed when it reinforces realism.

---

## 5) Devices & Techniques

**Must have:**
- At least one tension (contrast, paradox, or inversion).  
- Clear boundary on claims (“works until / unless…”).  
- One sensory or numeric anchor.

**Elastic margins:**
- Questions optional — use to wake thought, not fill space.  
- Equations or thresholds allowed but not required.  
- Swearing permitted only if it increases precision or emotion.

## 6) Voice Integrity Table

| Aspect | Core | Elastic allowance |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| Tone | Hard truths, agency | 10–20 % empathy permitted |
| Diction | Short, clear | Occasional long clause for rhythm |
| Structure | Hook–Truth–Proof–Resolution | Steps may reorder |
| Evidence | Number or scene | Replaceable by vivid cause–effect |
| Point of view | Second person | “I” or “we” acceptable once for proof |
| Rhythm | Varied lengths | One long flow sentence allowed |
| Clarity | Mandatory | Poetry acceptable only if still clear |

---

## 7) Process (How to Produce)

1. **Draft fast.** Don’t censor voice on first pass.  
2. **Cut until crisp.** Remove 40–60 % words.  
3. **Add one concrete proof** (metric, scene, or contrast).  
4. **Check tone:** truth > comfort.  
5. **Read aloud:** if breathless, split.  
6. **Ship volume:** frequency beats polish.

---

## 8) Quality Check (Elastic Scoring)

Check each item loosely — intent over form.

| Item | Pass if... |
|------|-------------|
| Hook | First or second line sparks tension |
| Proof | Includes number, example, or believable cause |
| Agency | Reader feels in control after reading |
| Rhythm | Mixed sentence lengths |
| Originality | No recycled phrases |
| Energy | Finishes on conviction, not command |
| Humanity | At least one relatable phrase |

Aim for **4 / 5 or better** across items. Lower is fix-able; higher means publish.

---

## 9) Elastic Red Flags

- Motivation wallpaper (no tension or proof).  
- Over-templated rhythm (five equal lines).  
- Preachy imperatives with no boundary.  
- Too polished or “AI-clean”.  
- Numbers with no emotional anchor.  
- Soft abstractions (*success, greatness, impact*) ungrounded.

---

## 10) Editor Prompts (for human or AI feedback)

Ask after each draft:
- What truth am I forcing the reader to face?  
- Where’s the friction or boundary?  
- Is there at least one concrete anchor?  
- Does it feel like a person, not a pattern?

If any answer is “no,” adjust one variable — never all.

---

## 11) Final Reminders

- **Essence over form.** Style serves substance.  
- **Variation over cloning.** Every post should feel lived, not printed.  
- **Proof over poetry.** Numbers or examples keep it honest.  
- **Belief before instruction.** Conviction is the real hook.  
- **Flow over format.** A little mess is human.
