# Comprehensive Voice Contract — Alex Hormozi Style
*(Working spec for writers and editors. English.)*

---

## 0) Purpose & Scope
This contract defines how to **write in Alex Hormozi’s voice** without plagiarizing him. It captures the *essence*—direct, evidence-minded, action-driving prose—so any writer can deliver consistent copy across posts, threads, emails, landing pages, and long-form.

**Goal:** Produce writing that feels like a high-performance coach: **simple words, hard truths, useful tactics, zero fluff.**  
**Non-Goal:** Sounding like a parody or fanboy. Don’t mimic exact phrasing, stories, or proprietary frameworks verbatim.

**Legal/Ethical:** Quote sparingly with attribution. Do **not** lift distinctive passages from his books or posts.

---

## 1) Pillars of Voice (Tone & Attitude)
**What it feels like:** Tough-love coach who believes you can win if you face reality and execute.

- **Direct, No-Nonsense.** Say the thing. Cut hedges and filler.  
  *“It costs more, takes longer, and hurts more than you think.”*
- **Empowering Responsibility.** Put agency on the reader.  
  *“The market is your mirror. If it’s not buying, fix you.”*
- **Optimistic Realism.** Pain is a toll, not a tragedy.  
  *“Anxiety means you’re stretching your capacity.”*
- **Polarizing Edge.** Invite disagreement when truth is useful.  
  *“Most small businesses don’t need more ideas, they need more execution.”*

**Avoid:** syrupy motivation, passive voice, vague generalities, sentimental storytelling that doesn’t advance a point.

---

## 2) Language Rules (Diction & Syntax)
- **Simple Words.** 4th–6th grade readability. Say *win, lose, stuck, proof, volume, reps*.  
- **Strong Verbs.** *Ship. Sell. Scale. Cut. Focus. Execute. Pay. Train.*  
- **Numbers Beat Adjectives.** Use quantifiers and thresholds. *“Under $1M/yr? Advertise more.”*  
- **Short Sentences.** Default: one clause. Rarely more than one comma.  
- **Repetition for Emphasis.** Repeat a key word or rhythm to drive memory.  
- **Second Person (“you”).** Speak to one operator.

**Ban List:** jargon (*synergy, paradigm, leverage* as a noun), academic hedges (*may, might, perhaps*—unless needed for precision), decorative metaphors that obscure meaning.

---

## 3) Structure & Formatting
- **Hook → Truth → Proof → Action.** (H-T-P-A)
  - *Hook:* one-line claim or tension.  
  - *Truth:* the principle.  
  - *Proof:* number, example, contrast, equation, or simple model.  
  - *Action:* what to do next.
- **Micro-Paragraphs.** 1–3 sentences per paragraph.  
- **Lists for Steps & Contrasts.** Prefer bullets or 1-2-3.  
- **Punchy Closes.** End on an imperative or inversion.  
- **All-Caps Sparingly.** Emphasize one term max: *PROOF, VOLUME, FOCUS.*

**Lengths:**  
- X/Threads: 100–280 chars (single), 1–6 bullets (thread).  
- LI posts: 120–220 words.  
- Email: 200–400 words, skimmable.  
- Long-form: sections of 200–400 words with clear subheads.

---

## 4) Themes & Angles (What to Talk About)
- **Mindset as Throughput:** pain, sacrifice, discipline, long horizon, ownership.  
- **Execution over Ideation:** volume, reps, offer-market fit, proof stacks.  
- **Acquisition Basics:** advertise more, publish more, build proof, follow up.  
- **Operator Reality:** tradeoffs, constraints, math of growth, boring work that scales.  
- **Wealth Frames:** results over optics; process over hacks.

**Off-limits:** politics, gossip, vague lifestyle tips, personal confessions without utility.

---

## 5) Rhetorical Devices (How to Hit)
- **Contrast Pairs:** *“Poor vs rich actions.” “Amateur vs pro.”*  
- **Inversions:** *“You don’t have a competitor problem; you have an obscurity problem.”*  
- **Threshold Rules:** *“If <X, then do Y.”*  
- **Mini-Equations:** Keep them simple and legible.  
- **Rhetorical Questions:** Use sparingly to set up a punch.  
- **One Metaphor Max:** per piece, and obvious (e.g., *“currency of respect is work.”*)

---

## 6) Do / Don’t (Quick Reference)

| Aspect | Do | Don’t |
|---|---|---|

| Diction | **Short, common words** | MBA jargon or Latinate fluff |
| Structure | **Hook → Truth → Proof → Action** | Long intros, soft closes |
| Evidence | **Numbers, thresholds, simple rules** | Vibes, “people say,” name-drops |
| Engagement | **Second person (“you”)** | Abstract “we as a society” takes |
| Emphasis | **One cap word max** | All-caps rants |
| Ethics | **Attribute quotes/frameworks** | Copy distinctive lines |

## 7) Templates (Fill-In)
**A) One-Liner (X/Threads)**

- *Under ______/year? Do ______ first. Everything else is a distraction.*

## 8) Examples (Original, On-Voice)

**Example 1 — Mindset**  
*Hook:* You’re not blocked. You’re avoiding the work.  
*Truth:* Skill compounds. Avoidance compounds faster.  
*Proof:* 100 cold calls beat 100 ideas.  
*Action:* Make 20 calls before lunch. Track yes/no. Repeat daily.

**Example 2 — Acquisition Threshold**  
Under $1M/year? Advertise more.  
Not because ads are magic—because **no one knows you exist**.

**Example 3 — Contrast**  
Amateurs chase motivation. Pros build routines.  
Routines survive bad days. Motivation doesn’t.

**Example 4 — Offer Proof**  
Confidence comes from **evidence**: volume × consistency.  
Do the reps. Then believe.

---

## 9) Writing Process (How to Produce This Voice)
1. **Block Time (Deep Work).** 2–3 hour blocks, phone away.  
2. **Draft Ugly, Fast.** Aim for 3× the final length.  
3. **Cut 40–60%.** Shorten sentences. Kill hedges. Remove one metaphor.  
4. **Add Numbers.** Replace adjectives with thresholds, counts, or timelines.  
5. **Action Check.** Every piece ends with a concrete next step.  
6. **Read Aloud Test.** If you run out of breath, it’s two sentences.  
7. **Ship Volume.** Track daily outputs and response (CTR, saves, replies).

---

## 10) QA Checklist (Tick Before You Ship)
- [ ] Hook in line 1?  
- [ ] At least **one** number or threshold?  
- [ ] **You-voice** throughout?  
- [ ] One clear **Action** at the end?  
- [ ] No jargon, no hedges, no fluff?  
- [ ] ≤ 1 metaphor, ≤ 1 ALL-CAPS word?  
- [ ] Readability: Grade 6–7 or lower?  
- [ ] Nothing copied; quotes attributed?

---

## 11) Red Flags (Smells Like Fake-Hormozi)
- Motivational wallpaper with zero numbers.  
- Generic hustle clichés.  
- Five-sentence paragraphs; triple-comma sentences.  
- Lists with fancy words and no actions.  
- Over-complex frameworks or math cosplay.

---

## 12) Scoring Rubric (0–5)
- **5** = Hook hits. Numbers present. Clear action. Zero fluff. Feels like a coach.  
- **4** = Strong but one miss (weak number or soft close).  
- **3** = Usable; needs cuts and a number.  
- **2** = Motivational fog; rewrites required.  
- **1** = Off-voice; send back.

---

## 13) Mini Style Guide (Mechanics)
- **Case:** Sentence case; no Title Case in body.  
- **Hyphens:** prefer *tough-love, pay-off*.  
- **Numbers:** Use numerals (3, 10, 1,000).  
- **Swear Words:** If used, purposeful and sparse.  
- **Quotes:** Block or inline with attribution.

---

## 14) Adaptation Patterns (Channel-Specific)

**Threads/X (single):**  
- 1 hard truth or 1 threshold rule. 1 line. 100–180 chars.

**Threads/X (thread 4–6):**  
1) Hook  
2–4) Truth + Proof bullets  
5) Action  
6) One-line close

**LinkedIn:**  
- 120–220 words. Broken into 3–5 mini-paragraphs + a list.  
- End with 1 question that forces a choice (*“Which one will you do today?”*).

**Email (short lesson):**  
- Subject = result + constraint (*“Add $10k/mo without new leads”*).  
- H-T-P-A body, 200–350 words.

---

## 15) Quick Start (10-Minute Draft Flow)
1. Write 10 hooks. Pick 1.  
2. State 1 truth in 12 words.  
3. Add 1 number (threshold, count, or time).  
4. End with 1 action the reader can do today.  
5. Cut 50%. Ship.

---

## 16) Example Rewrites (Before → After)

**Before:**  
“Success requires a paradigm shift in your approach to marketing strategy.”  
**After:**  
“Want more revenue? Make more offers. Track closes. Fix the one step that leaks.”

**Before:**  
“We often underestimate the importance of consistent public communication.”  
**After:**  
“No one buys if no one knows you. Publish daily. Sell weekly. Ask daily.”

---

## 17) Editor Notes (How to Coach Writers)
- Ask: *Where’s the proof? Where’s the action?*  
- Replace 2 adjectives with 1 number.  
- Split any sentence with two commas.  
- Make the close command-like: *Do X by Y.*

---

## 18) Final Reminders
- **Essence over imitation.** Be useful, blunt, specific.  
- **Volume over perfection.** Reps create signal.  
- **Evidence over ego.** Numbers, not narratives, win.
