The Checklist:
1.  Unambiguous Validation — starts with clear agreement.
2.  No Contradiction — connects to the author's term, no "it's not X, it's Y".
3.  Non-Confrontational Tone — 100% constructive.
4.  Trojan Horse — integrates a core operational term (system, asset, etc.).

Your Task:
Return a strict JSON object.
- If compliant: {"is_compliant": true, "reason": "Adheres to all principles."}
- If non-compliant: {"is_compliant": false, "reason": "<Rule broken>", "corrected_text": "<Rewrite to be 100% compliant.>"}
